        Please keep in mind that the GitHub issue tracker is not intended as a general support forum, but for reporting **non-security** bugs and feature requests.

        If you're reporting the presence of a disclosed security vulnerability, such as a CVE reported in one of our container images, please follow our [vulnerability reporting guidelines](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/vulnerability-reporting.md).

        If you believe you have an issue that affects the security of .NET, please do NOT create an issue and instead email your issue details to secure@microsoft.com.
        Your report may be eligible for our [bug bounty](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core) but ONLY if it is reported through email.

        For other types of questions, consider posting to [Discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).
