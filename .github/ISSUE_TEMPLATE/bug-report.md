<!--
Please keep in mind that the GitHub issue tracker is not intended as a general support forum, but for reporting **non-security** bugs and feature requests.

If you're reporting the presence of an already disclosed security vulnerability, such as a CVE, you must follow the documented guidance on vulnerability reporting at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/vulnerability-reporting.md.

If you believe you have an issue that affects the security of .NET, please do NOT create an issue and instead email your issue details to secure@microsoft.com. Your report may be eligible for our bug bounty (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core) but ONLY if it is reported through email.

For other types of questions, consider posting to Discussions (https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions) or Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com).
