1. - [ ] Inspect generated changes for correctness
1. - [ ] Commit generated changes
1. - [ ] Create PR

1. - [ ] Merge PR
1. - [ ] Wait for changes to be mirrored to internal [dotnet-docker repo](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-dotnet-docker) (internal MSFT link)
1. - [ ] Build images - Queue build stage of [dotnet-docker pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=373) (internal MSFT link) with variables:

      Servicing release:

          imageBuilder.pathArgs: --path '2.1*' --path '3.0*' --path '3.1*'
          stages: build
1. - [ ] Wait for NuGet packages to be published during release tic-toc
1. - [ ] Test and publish images - Queue build of [dotnet-docker pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=373) (internal MSFT link) with variables:

      Servicing release:

          imageBuilder.pathArgs: --path '2.1*' --path '3.0*' --path '3.1*'
          stages: test;publish
          sourceBuildId: <Build ID from the build stage>
1. - [ ] Confirm images have been ingested by MCR
1. - [ ] Confirm READMEs have been updated in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core)
1. - [ ] Confirm build for [dotnet-docker-samples](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=376) (internal MSFT link) was queued. This will be queued automatically by [dotnet-docker-tools-check-base-image-updates](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=536) when it detects that the product images have been updated (detection runs on a schedule). Alternatively, you can manually queue the samples build.
1. - [ ] Confirm sample images have been ingested by MCR
1. - [ ] Confirm README has been updated in Docker Hub for [microsoft-dotnet-core-samples](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-samples/)

## 2. Nightly Branch Tasks

1. - [ ] Inspect generated changes for correctness
1. - [ ] Commit generated changes
1. - [ ] Create PR
1. - [ ] Get PR signoff
1. - [ ] Merge PR
1. - [ ] Wait for automatically queued CI build to finish on [dotnet-docker-nightly pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=359) (internal MSFT link)
1. - [ ] Confirm images have been ingested by MCR
