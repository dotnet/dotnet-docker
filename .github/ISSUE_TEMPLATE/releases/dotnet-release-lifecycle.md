# New .NET Version Release Lifecycle

This document is a collection of tasks that need to be completed over the lifecycle of a .NET release.
Each top-level checkbox represents an issue that should be filed.
File all release and pre-release issues at once when a new .NET version is in Alpha.
File an issue for removing an EOL .NET version *after* its last release, so that it can be removed before the next release.
Add due dates to each of the issues so that we don't lose track of them.

### Breaking changes
- For each breaking change made throughout development, file a new issue using the ".NET breaking change" template in the [dotnet/docs repo](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/new/choose).
- List any breaking change issues created below:

## Alpha
- [ ] Add new .NET version images to `nightly` branch
    - [ ] Create new images
        - [ ] Add entries for the new .NET versions in `manifest.versions.json`
        - [ ] Add new images for the new .NET version in each repo in `manifest.json`
            - [ ] Move `latest` tags to the new .NET version
            - [ ] Floating tags should have a `-preview` suffix (https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/4117). For example: `9.0-preview`.
            - For fixed tags, the `-alpha.1` suffixes that is part of the .NET version sufficient and no additional suffix is necessary
        - Adjust existing templates or add new templates in `eng/dockerfile-templates/` if necessary
        - If there are no major changes between .NET versions, the new images can share `runtime-deps` layers with the previous .NET version
        - Include only the latest/LTS version of each operating system according to our [supported operating systems documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-platforms.md#operating-systems).
            - If adding a new OS version, follow the guidelines in [new-distro-release.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/releases/new-distro-release.md)
        - If PowerShell is not yet supported or functional on the new .NET version, file an issue at [PowerShell/PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues) or link to an existing issue, exclude PowerShell from the new SDK images, and [file an issue](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/new/choose) to re-enable PowerShell in .NET Docker images
    - [ ] Update tests
        - [ ] Add new version info to [ImageVersion.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/nightly/tests/Microsoft.DotNet.Docker.Tests/ImageVersion.cs)
        - [ ] Update the [test data](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/nightly/tests/Microsoft.DotNet.Docker.Tests/TestData.cs) to include the new distro version
        - If various tests are not yet functional on the new .NET version, file issues on product team repos as necessary, disable the test with a link to the issue, and file an issue in the dotnet/dotnet-docker repo to re-enable the test
    - [ ] Update readmes
        - [ ] Update the [MCR tags metadata templates](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/tree/main/eng/mcr-tags-metadata-templates) to include the new distro version
            - The new tags should be in a preview sub-table, like so: https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/8fc28db4f706d81a1fd075f2c6b2ca514ae75c84/eng/mcr-tags-metadata-templates/aspnet-tags.yml#L1-L3
    - [ ] Update image size baselines
        - [ ] Queue a build of the [dotnet-docker-nightly](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=359) pipeline
        - [ ] Inspect the image sizes by pulling the new images from the `dotnetdocker` ACR and update the baselines accordingly

        - [ ] Add new .NET Version to Featured Tags as "(Release Candidate)" in `main` branch
- [ ] Move .NET Docker projects to the new .NET version's TFM

- [ ] Review supported OS versions for new .NET version before release
    - Include only the latest/LTS version of each operating system according to our [supported operating systems documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-platforms.md#operating-systems).
