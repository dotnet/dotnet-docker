## About

**IMPORTANT**
**The images from the dotnet/nightly repositories include last-known-good (LKG) builds for the next release of [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core).**

**See [dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet/) for images with official releases of [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core).**

This image contains the .NET runtimes and libraries and is optimized for running .NET apps in production.

Watch [discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions/categories/announcements) for Docker-related .NET announcements.

## Usage

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

## Container sample: Run a simple application

You can quickly run a container with a pre-built [.NET Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-samples/), based on the [.NET console sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/README.md).

Type the following command to run a sample console application:

```console
docker run --rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples
```
