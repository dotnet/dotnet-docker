## About

**IMPORTANT**
**The images from the dotnet/nightly repositories include last-known-good (LKG) builds for the next release of [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core).**

**See [dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet/) for images with official releases of [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core).**

This image contains the native dependencies needed by .NET. It does not include .NET. It is for [self-contained](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/deploying/index) applications.

Watch [discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions/categories/announcements) for Docker-related .NET announcements.

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

* [.NET self-contained Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/dotnet-docker-selfcontained.md) - This [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/Dockerfile.debian-x64-selfcontained) builds and runs an application as a self-contained application.
