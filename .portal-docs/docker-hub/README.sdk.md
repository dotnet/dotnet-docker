# About

This image contains the .NET SDK which is comprised of three parts:

1. .NET CLI
1. .NET runtime
1. ASP.NET Core

Use this image for your development process (developing, building and testing applications).

Watch [discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions/categories/announcements) for Docker-related .NET announcements.

# Usage

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

## Building .NET Apps with Docker

* [.NET Docker Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/README.md) - This [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/Dockerfile) builds, tests, and runs the sample. It includes and builds multiple projects.
* [ASP.NET Core Docker Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/README.md) - This [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/Dockerfile) demonstrates using Docker with an ASP.NET Core Web App.

## Develop .NET Apps in a Container

The following samples show how to develop, build and test .NET applications with Docker without the need to install the .NET SDK.

* [Build .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/build-in-sdk-container.md)
* [Test .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/run-tests-in-sdk-container.md)
* [Run .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/run-in-sdk-container.md)

# Image Variants

.NET container images have several variants that offer different combinations of flexibility and deployment size.
The [Image Variants documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/image-variants.md) contains a summary of the image variants and their use-cases.

## Lifecycle

* [Microsoft Support for .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/support.md)
* [Supported Container Platforms Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-platforms.md)
* [Supported Tags Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-tags.md)

## Image Update Policy

* **Base Image Updates:** Images are re-built within 12 hours of any updates to their base images (e.g. debian:bookworm-slim, windows/nanoserver:ltsc2022, etc.).
* **.NET Releases:** Images are re-built as part of releasing new .NET versions. This includes new major versions, minor versions, and servicing releases.
* **Critical CVEs:** Images are re-built to pick up critical CVE fixes as described by the CVE Update Policy below.
* **Monthly Re-builds:** Images are re-built monthly, typically on the second Tuesday of the month, in order to pick up lower-severity CVE fixes.
* **Out-Of-Band Updates:** Images can sometimes be re-built when out-of-band updates are necessary to address critical issues. If this happens, new fixed version tags will be updated according to the [Fixed version tags documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-tags.md#fixed-version-tags).

### CVE Update Policy

.NET container images are regularly monitored for the presence of CVEs. A given image will be rebuilt to pick up fixes for a CVE when:

* We detect the image contains a CVE with a [CVSS](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) score of "Critical"
* **AND** the CVE is in a package that is added in our Dockerfile layers (meaning the CVE is in a package we explicitly install or any transitive dependencies of those packages)
* **AND** there is a CVE fix for the package available in the affected base image's package repository.

Please refer to the [Security Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/SECURITY.md) and [Container Vulnerability Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/vulnerability-reporting.md) for more detail about what to do when a CVE is encountered in a .NET image.
