# About

This image contains the .NET Monitor tool.

Use this image as a sidecar container to collect diagnostic information from other containers running .NET Core 3.1 or later processes.

Watch [discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions/categories/announcements) for Docker-related .NET announcements.

## New: Ubuntu Chiseled Images

Ubuntu Chiseled .NET images are a type of "distroless" container image that contain only the minimal set of packages .NET needs, with everything else removed.
These images offer dramatically smaller deployment sizes and attack surface by including only the minimal set of packages required to run .NET applications.

Please see the [Ubuntu Chiseled + .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/ubuntu-chiseled.md) documentation page for more info.

# Usage

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

## Container sample: Run the tool

You can run a container with a pre-built [.NET Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-monitor/), based on the dotnet-monitor global tool.

See the [documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2158052) for how to configure the image to be run in a Docker or Kubernetes environment, including how to configure authentication and certificates for https bindings.

## Lifecycle

* [Microsoft Support for .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/support.md)
* [Supported Container Platforms Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-platforms.md)
* [Supported Tags Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-tags.md)

## Image Update Policy

* **Base Image Updates:** Images are re-built within 12 hours of any updates to their base images (e.g. debian:bookworm-slim, windows/nanoserver:ltsc2022, etc.).
* **.NET Releases:** Images are re-built as part of releasing new .NET versions. This includes new major versions, minor versions, and servicing releases.
* **Critical CVEs:** Images are re-built to pick up critical CVE fixes as described by the CVE Update Policy below.
* **Monthly Re-builds:** Images are re-built monthly, typically on the second Tuesday of the month, in order to pick up lower-severity CVE fixes.
* **Out-Of-Band Updates:** Images can sometimes be re-built when out-of-band updates are necessary to address critical issues. If this happens, new fixed version tags will be updated according to the [Fixed version tags documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-tags.md#fixed-version-tags).

### CVE Update Policy

.NET container images are regularly monitored for the presence of CVEs. A given image will be rebuilt to pick up fixes for a CVE when:

* We detect the image contains a CVE with a [CVSS](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) score of "Critical"
* **AND** the CVE is in a package that is added in our Dockerfile layers (meaning the CVE is in a package we explicitly install or any transitive dependencies of those packages)
* **AND** there is a CVE fix for the package available in the affected base image's package repository.

Please refer to the [Security Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/SECURITY.md) and [Container Vulnerability Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/vulnerability-reporting.md) for more detail about what to do when a CVE is encountered in a .NET image.
