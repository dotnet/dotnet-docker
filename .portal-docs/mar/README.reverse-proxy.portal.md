This image contains an implementation of YARP, a reverse proxy framework in .NET.

## Usage

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

You can run this image to launch a YARP instance.

YARP expects the config file to be in `/etc/reverse-proxy.config`, and listens by default on port 5000.

Example of configuration:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ReverseProxy": {
    "Routes": {
      "route1": {
        "ClusterId": "cluster1",
        "Match": {
          "Path": "/aspnetapp/{**catch-all}"
        },
        "Transforms": [
            { "PathRemovePrefix": "/aspnetapp" }
        ]
      }
    },
    "Clusters": {
      "cluster1": {
        "Destinations": {
          "destination1": {
            "Address": "http://aspnetapp1:8080"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It can then be used with the following command (where `my-config.config` is a file containing this configuration):

```bash
docker run --rm --name myaspnetapp -d -t  mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp 
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/my-config.config:/etc/reverse-proxy.config -p 5000:5000 --link myaspnetapp:aspnetapp1 mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/reverse-proxy:latest
```

This example will proxy every requests from `http://localhost:5000/aspnetapp` to the `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp` container deployed.

The [YARP GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/reverse-proxy/tree/main/samples/) contains more configuration samples.

For more details, see the [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/articles/index.html) for how to configure the image and documentation for the reverse proxy configuration.

## Support

### Lifecycle

* [Microsoft Support for YARP](https://github.com/microsoft/reverse-proxy/blob/main/docs/roadmap.md)
* [Microsoft Support for .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/support.md)
* [Supported Container Platforms Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-platforms.md)
* [Supported Tags Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-tags.md)

### Image Update Policy

* **Base Image Updates:** Images are re-built within 12 hours of any updates to their base images (e.g. debian:bookworm-slim, windows/nanoserver:ltsc2022, etc.).
* **.NET Releases:** Images are re-built as part of releasing new .NET versions. This includes new major versions, minor versions, and servicing releases.
* **Critical CVEs:** Images are re-built to pick up critical CVE fixes as described by the CVE Update Policy below.
* **Monthly Re-builds:** Images are re-built monthly, typically on the second Tuesday of the month, in order to pick up lower-severity CVE fixes.
* **Out-Of-Band Updates:** Images can sometimes be re-built when out-of-band updates are necessary to address critical issues. If this happens, new fixed version tags will be updated according to the [Fixed version tags documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-tags.md#fixed-version-tags).

#### CVE Update Policy

.NET container images are regularly monitored for the presence of CVEs. A given image will be rebuilt to pick up fixes for a CVE when:

* We detect the image contains a CVE with a [CVSS](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) score of "Critical"
* **AND** the CVE is in a package that is added in our Dockerfile layers (meaning the CVE is in a package we explicitly install or any transitive dependencies of those packages)
* **AND** there is a CVE fix for the package available in the affected base image's package repository.

Please refer to the [Security Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/SECURITY.md) and [Container Vulnerability Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/vulnerability-reporting.md) for more detail about what to do when a CVE is encountered in a .NET image.
