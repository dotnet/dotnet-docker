## About

This image contains the .NET SDK which is comprised of three parts:

1. .NET CLI
1. .NET runtime
1. ASP.NET Core

Use this image for your development process (developing, building and testing applications).

Watch [discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions/categories/announcements) for Docker-related .NET announcements.

## Usage

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

### Building .NET Apps with Docker

* [.NET Docker Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/README.md) - This [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/Dockerfile) builds, tests, and runs the sample. It includes and builds multiple projects.
* [ASP.NET Core Docker Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/README.md) - This [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/Dockerfile) demonstrates using Docker with an ASP.NET Core Web App.

### Develop .NET Apps in a Container

The following samples show how to develop, build and test .NET applications with Docker without the need to install the .NET SDK.

* [Build .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/build-in-sdk-container.md)
* [Test .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/run-tests-in-sdk-container.md)
* [Run .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/run-in-sdk-container.md)

## Image Variants

.NET container images have several variants that offer different combinations of flexibility and deployment size.
The [Image Variants documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/image-variants.md) contains a summary of the image variants and their use-cases.

## Support

### Lifecycle

* [Microsoft Support for .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/support.md)
* [Supported Container Platforms Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-platforms.md)
* [Supported Tags Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-tags.md)

### Image Update Policy

* We update supported .NET images within 12 hours of any updates to their base images (e.g. debian:bookworm-slim, windows/nanoserver:ltsc2022, etc.).
* We re-build all .NET images as part of releasing new versions of .NET including new major/minor versions and servicing.
* Distroless images such as Ubuntu Chiseled have no base image, and as such will only be updated with .NET releases and CVE fixes as described below.

#### CVE Update Policy

.NET container images are regularly monitored for the presence of CVEs. A given image will be rebuilt to pick up fixes for a CVE when:
* We detect the image contains a CVE with a [CVSS](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) score of "Critical"
* **AND** the CVE is in a package that is added in our Dockerfile layers (meaning the CVE is in a package we explicitly install or any transitive dependencies of those packages)
* **AND** there is a CVE fix for the package available in the affected base image's package repository.
