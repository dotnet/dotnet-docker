    _ The sdk-extract-groups arg is an array of maps. We want to reduce that to just a single array of formatted
        paths. The "for" keyword doesn't work here because we don't want to echo any output. Instead, we'll call
        the map function to enumerate the array. For each group in the array, it'll format the paths of the groups
        and append them to the sdkExtractPaths. The output of the map function isn't used; it's strictly a way to execute
        arbitrary code for each item in the array. ^
