## Container sample: Run a simple application

You can quickly run a container with a pre-built [.NET Core Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-samples/), based on the [.NET Core console sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/dotnetapp/README.md).

Type the following command to run a sample console application:

```console
docker run --rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/samples
```
