Starting from .NET 8, a composite version of the ASP.NET images, `denoted with the -composite` tag part, is being offered alongside the regular image. The main characteristics of these images are their smaller size on disk while keeping the performance of the default [ReadyToRun (R2R) setting](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run). The caveat is that the composite images have tighter version coupling. This means the final app run on them cannot use handpicked custom versions of the framework and/or ASP.NET assemblies that are built into the composite binary.

For a full technical description on how the composites work, we have a [feature doc here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/features/readytorun-composite-format-design.md).
