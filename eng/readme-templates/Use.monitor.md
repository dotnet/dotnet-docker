## Container sample: Run the tool

You can run a container with a pre-built [.NET Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-monitor/), based on the dotnet-monitor global tool.

See the [documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2158052) for how to configure the image to be run in a Docker or Kubernetes environment, including how to configure authentication and certificates for https bindings.
