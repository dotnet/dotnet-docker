.NET "distroless" container images contain only the minimal set of packages .NET needs, with everything else removed.
Due to their limited set of packages, distroless containers have a minimized security attack surface, smaller deployment sizes, and faster start-up time compared to their non-distroless counterparts.
They contain the following features:

* Minimal set of packages required for .NET applications
* Non-root user by default
* No package manager
* No shell

.NET offers distroless images for [Azure Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/azurelinux.md) and [Ubuntu (Chiseled)](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/ubuntu-chiseled.md).
