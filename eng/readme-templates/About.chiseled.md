Ubuntu Chiseled .NET images are a type of "distroless" container image that contain only the minimal set of packages .NET needs, with everything else removed.
These images offer dramatically smaller deployment sizes and attack surface by including only the minimal set of packages required to run .NET applications.

Please see the [Ubuntu Chiseled + .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/ubuntu-chiseled.md) documentation page for more info.
