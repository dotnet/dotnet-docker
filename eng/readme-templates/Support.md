{{if match(SHORT_REPO, "samples"):These sample images are not intended for production use and may be subject to breaking changes or removal at any time. They are provided as a starting point for developers to experiment with and learn about .NET in a containerized environment.

}}{{ARGS["top-header"]}}# Lifecycle

* [Microsoft Support for .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/support.md)
* [Supported Container Platforms Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-platforms.md)
* [Supported Tags Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/supported-tags.md)

{{ARGS["top-header"]}}# Image Update Policy

* We update supported .NET images within 12 hours of any updates to their base images (e.g. debian:bookworm-slim, windows/nanoserver:ltsc2022, etc.).
* We re-build all .NET images as part of releasing new versions of .NET including new major/minor versions and servicing.
* Distroless images such as Ubuntu Chiseled have no base image, and as such will only be updated with .NET releases and CVE fixes as described below.

{{ARGS["top-header"]}}## CVE Update Policy

.NET container images are regularly monitored for the presence of CVEs. A given image will be rebuilt to pick up fixes for a CVE when:
* We detect the image contains a CVE with a [CVSS](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) score of "Critical"
* **AND** the CVE is in a package that is added in our Dockerfile layers (meaning the CVE is in a package we explicitly install or any transitive dependencies of those packages)
* **AND** there is a CVE fix for the package available in the affected base image's package repository.
