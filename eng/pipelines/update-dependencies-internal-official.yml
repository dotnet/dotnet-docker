# This pipeline expects there to be a variable named "targetBranch" defined
# in the Azure Pipelines GUI. It should be able to be overridden at pipeline
# queue time. A pull request will be created targeting that branch.
# It is not a parameter since it needs to be permanent but also changed to the
# next release branch every month without modifying the pipeline YAML.
