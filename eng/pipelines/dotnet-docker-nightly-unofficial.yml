parameters:
- name: sourceBuildPipelineRunId
  displayName: >
    Source build pipeline run ID. This refers to runs of *this pipeline*.
    Override this parameter in combination with disabling the `Build` stage to
    test or publish images that were built in a different pipeline run. When
    building new images, leave this value alone.
  type: string
  default: $(Build.BuildId)

- name: publishRepoPrefix
  displayName: >
    Publish repo prefix. Final images will be pushed under this prefix in the
    production ACR. Examples: `public/`, `test/`
  type: string
  default: "public/"

- name: noCache
  displayName: >
    Run build with no cache. When this is unchecked, the build will use the
    info in the dotnet/versions repo to build only the images which have had
    Dockerfile changes or base images updates. When this is checked, all images
    will be built.
