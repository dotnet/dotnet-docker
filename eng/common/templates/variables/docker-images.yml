  # This variable is referenced by the pipeline when it needs the name of the Image Builder image.
  # It's defined separately from the imageNames.imageBuilderName variable so that it can be overridden
  # by the pipeline without possibly causing a cyclic dependency. For example, an overriding pipeline
  # may want to base the name of the Image Builder image from the original value of the variable. If
  # there wasn't a separate variable for the name, you couldn't set imageNames.imageBuilder to
  # $(imageNames.imageBuilder)-<suffix>, for example, because that would create a cyclic dependency. But
  # you can set imageNames.imageBuilder to $(imageNames.imageBuilderName)-<suffix>.
