# If package manager is apk
if type apk > /dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
    # Extract the package name and version out of the list of installed packages.
    # This uses the output of the "apk info" command to build a regex to find the version from the "apk list"
    # command. The reason the "apk info -v" or "apk list --installed" commands (which provide both the package name and version)
    # aren't used just by itself is because of the ambiguity between what characters are part of the package name and which are 
    # part of the version. For example, the output for something like "libssl1.1-1.1.1k-r0" can be ambiguous because of the dash 
    # separator. In this case, the package name is "libssl1.1" and the version is "1.1.1k-r0". You can't necessarily assume that 
    # the first '-' character indicates a version separator because some package names also contain a '-' character.  What the 
    # command below does is to first get the list of package names (w/o any versions) and then feed each package name into another
    # command to lookup that package name with the "apk list" command to get the version details.
    # Example of the output of "apk info -d musl":
    #   musl-1.2.2-r3 description:
    #   the musl c library (libc) implementation
    # Output is the format of "APK,<pkg-name>=<pkg-version>"
