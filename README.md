## What is .NET Core?

.NET Core is a general purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/core). It is cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS and Linux, and can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.

.NET has several capabilities that make development easier, including automatic memory management, (runtime) generic types, reflection, asynchrony, concurrency, and native interop. Millions of developers take advantage of these capabilities to efficiently build high-quality applications.

You can use C# to write .NET Core apps. C# is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages. Anyone familiar with C and similar languages will find it straightforward to write in C#.

[.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) is open source (MIT and Apache 2 licenses) and was contributed to the [.NET Foundation](http://dotnetfoundation.org) by Microsoft in 2014. It can be freely adopted by individuals and companies, including for personal, academic or commercial purposes. Multiple companies use .NET Core as part of apps, tools, new platforms and hosting services.

## How to use these Images

### Run a simple application within a container

You can run a [sample application](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-samples/) (Linux image) that depends on these images in a container by running the following command.

```console
docker run microsoft/dotnet-samples
```

### Use multi-stage build with a .NET Core application

.NET Core Docker images can use [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/multistage-build/). This feature allows multiple FROM instructions to be used in one Dockerfile. Using this feature, you can build a .NET Core app using an SDK image (AKA 'build image') and then copy the published app into a lighter weight runtime image within a single Dockerfile.

 You can check out our [multi-stage build samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples) on GitHub for ASP.NET apps, production scenarios, and self-contained scenarios.

Add a `Dockerfile` to your .NET project with the following:

```dockerfile
FROM microsoft/dotnet:sdk AS build-env
WORKDIR /app

# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY *.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore

# copy everything else and build
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

# build runtime image
FROM microsoft/dotnet:runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-env /app/out ./
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "dotnetapp.dll"]
```

Build and run the Docker image:

```console
docker build -t dotnetapp .
docker run --rm dotnetapp Hello .NET Core from Docker
```

The `Dockerfile` and the Docker commands assumes that your application is called `dotnetapp`. You can change the `Dockerfile` and the commands, as needed.

### Build and run an application with a .NET Core SDK Image

You can use the .NET Core SDK Docker image as a build and runtime environment. It's a useful image for iterative development and the easiest way to get started using .NET Core with Docker. It isn't recommended for production since it's a bigger image than necessary, although it can work for that, too. You can try the instructions below or use the [dotnetapp-dev sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/tree/master/dotnetapp-dev) if you want to try a pre-made version that's ready go.

Create a Dockerfile with following lines, which will both build and run your application in the container. This Dockerfile has been optimized (note the two `COPY` commands) to take advantage of Docker layering, resulting in faster image building for iterative development.

```dockerfile
FROM microsoft/dotnet

WORKDIR /dotnetapp

# copy project.json and restore as distinct layers
COPY project.json .
RUN dotnet restore

# copy and build everything else
COPY . .
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "out/dotnetapp.dll"]
```

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```console
docker build -t dotnetapp .
docker run -it --rm dotnetapp
```

The `Dockerfile` and the Docker commands assumes that your application is called `dotnetapp`. You can change the `Dockerfile` and the commands, as needed.

### Interactively build and run a simple .NET Core application

You can interactively try out .NET Core by taking advantage of the convenience of a container. Try the following set of commands to create and run a .NET Core application in a minute (depending on your internet speed).

```console
docker run -it --rm microsoft/dotnet
[now in the container]
mkdir app
cd app
dotnet new console
ls
dotnet restore
dotnet run
dotnet bin/Debug/netcoreapp1.0/app.dll
dotnet publish -c Release -o out
dotnet out/app.dll
exit
 ```

The experience is very similar using [Windows Containers][win-containers]. The commands should be the same, with the exception `ls` and the directory separators.

The steps above are intended to show the basic functions of .NET Core tools. Try running `dotnet run` twice. You'll see that the second invocation skips compilation. The subsequent command after `dotnet run` demonstrates that you can run an application directly out of the bin folder, without the additional build logic that `dotnet run` adds. The last two commands demonstrate the publishing scenario, which prepares an app to be deployed on the same or other machine, with a requirement on only the .NET Core Runtime, not the larger SDK. Naturally, you don't have to exit immediately, but can continue to try out the product as long as you want.

You can extend your interactive exploration of .NET Core by git cloning the [dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples) repo. Try the following commands (only works on Linux containers), assuming you are running interactively in the container:

```console
git clone https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples
cd dotnet-docker-samples
cd dotnetapp-dev
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

## Interactively build and run an ASP.NET Core application

 You can interactively try out ASP.NET Core by taking advantage of the convenience of a container. Try the following set of commands to create and run an ASP.NET Core application in a minute (depending on your internet speed).

 ```console
docker run -p 8000:80 -e "ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80" -it --rm microsoft/dotnet
[now in the container]
mkdir app
cd app
dotnet new mvc
dotnet restore
dotnet run
exit
 ```

After running `dotnet run` in the container, browse to `http://localhost:8000` in your host machine.

The experience is very similar using [Windows Containers][win-containers]. The commands should be the same, with the exception of the `docker run`. Replace the `docker run` command above with the following two commands:

 ```console
docker run -e "ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80" -it --rm microsoft/dotnet
ipconfig
 ```
Copy the IP address from the output of `ipconfig`. After running `dotnet run` in the container, browse to that IP address in your browser on your host machine.

You should see a default ASP.NET Core site and logging activity in the container.

Please use the images at [microsoft/aspnetcore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/). They are recommended and optimized for ASP.NET core development and production and are built on the images in this repo.

## Image variants

The `microsoft/dotnet` images come in different flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

See [Building Docker Images for .NET Core Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more about the various Docker images and when to use each for them.

### `microsoft/dotnet:<version>-sdk`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

It contains the .NET Core SDK which is comprised of two parts:

1. .NET Core
1. .NET Core command line tools

Use this image for your development process (developing, building and testing applications).

### `microsoft/dotnet:<version>-runtime`

This image contains the .NET Core (runtime and libraries) and is optimized for running .NET Core apps in production.

### `microsoft/dotnet:<version>-runtime-deps`

This image contains the operating system with all of the native dependencies needed by .NET Core. This is for  [self-contained](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/deploying/index) applications.

## More Examples using these Images

You can learn more about using .NET Core with Docker with [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples):

- [.NET Core Development Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/tree/master/dotnetapp-dev) - This sample is good for development and building since it relies on the .NET Core SDK image. It performs `dotnet` commands on your behalf, reducing the time it takes to create Docker images (assuming you make changes and then test them in a container, iteratively).
- [.NET Core Docker Production Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/tree/master/dotnetapp-prod) - This sample is good for production since it relies on the .NET Core Runtime image, not the larger .NET Core SDK image. Most apps only need the runtime, reducing the size of your application image.
- [.NET Core self-contained application Docker Production Samp](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/tree/master/dotnetapp-selfcontained) - This sample is also good for production scenarios since it relies on an operating system image (without .NET Core). [Self-contained .NET Core apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/deploying/) include .NET Core as part of the app and not as a centrally installed component in a base image.
- [ASP.NET Core Docker Production Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/tree/master/aspnetapp) - This samples demonstrates a Dockerized ASP.NET Core Web App.
