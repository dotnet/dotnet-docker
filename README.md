# About

[.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/) is a general purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/core). It is cross-platform, supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, and can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.

.NET has several capabilities that make development productive, including automatic memory management, (runtime) generic types, reflection, [asynchronous constructs](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/async), concurrency, and native interop. Millions of developers take advantage of these capabilities to efficiently build high-quality applications.

You can use C# or F# to write .NET apps.

- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/) is powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages. Anyone familiar with C and similar languages will find it straightforward to write in C#.
- [F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/) is a cross-platform, open-source, functional programming language for .NET. It also includes object-oriented and imperative programming.

[.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core) is open source (MIT and Apache 2 licenses) and was contributed to the [.NET Foundation](http://dotnetfoundation.org) by Microsoft in 2014. It can be freely adopted by individuals and companies, including for personal, academic or commercial purposes. Multiple companies use .NET as part of apps, tools, new platforms and hosting services.

You are invited to [contribute new features](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.

## New: Ubuntu Chiseled Images

Ubuntu Chiseled .NET images are a type of "distroless" container image that contain only the minimal set of packages .NET needs, with everything else removed.
These images offer dramatically smaller deployment sizes and attack surface by including only the minimal set of packages required to run .NET applications.

Please see the [Ubuntu Chiseled + .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/ubuntu-chiseled.md) documentation page for more info.

# Usage

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

## Container sample: Run a simple application

You can quickly run a container with a pre-built [.NET Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-samples/), based on the [.NET console sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/README.md).

Type the following command to run a sample console application:

```console
docker run --rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples
```

## Container sample: Run a web application

You can quickly run a container with a pre-built [.NET Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-samples/), based on the [ASP.NET Core sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/README.md).

Type the following command to run a sample web application:

```console
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8080 --name aspnetcore_sample mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser. You can also view the ASP.NET Core site running in the container from another machine with a local IP address such as `http://192.168.1.18:8000`.

> Note: ASP.NET Core apps (in official images) listen to [port 8080 by default](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/6da64f31944bb16ecde5495b6a53fc170fbe100d/src/runtime-deps/8.0/bookworm-slim/amd64/Dockerfile#L7), starting with .NET 8. The [`-p` argument](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#publish) in these examples maps host port `8000` to container port `8080` (`host:container` mapping). The container will not be accessible without this mapping. ASP.NET Core can be [configured to listen on a different or additional port](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints).

See [Hosting ASP.NET Core Images with Docker over HTTPS](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/host-aspnetcore-https.md) to use HTTPS with this image.

# Image Variants

.NET container images have several variants that offer different combinations of flexibility and deployment size.
The [Image Variants documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/image-variants.md) contains a summary of the image variants and their use-cases.
