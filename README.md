# About .NET Core

[.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/) is a general purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/core). It is cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS and Linux, and can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.

.NET has several capabilities that make development easier, including a utomatic memory management, (runtime) generic types, reflection, asynchrony, concurrency, and native interop. Millions of developers take advantage of these capabilities to efficiently build high-quality applications.

You can use C# to write .NET Core apps. C# is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages. Anyone familiar with C and similar languages will find it straightforward to write in C#.

[.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) is open source (MIT and Apache 2 licenses) and was contributed to the [.NET Foundation](http://dotnetfoundation.org) by Microsoft in 2014. It can be freely adopted by individuals and companies, including for personal, academic or commercial purposes. Multiple companies use .NET Core as part of apps, tools, new platforms and hosting services.

You are invited to [contribute new features](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.

# How to Use the Images

The [.NET Core Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET Core and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Core Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

## Container sample: Run a simple application

You can quickly run a container with a pre-built [.NET Core Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-samples/), based on the [.NET Core console sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/dotnetapp/README.md).

Type the following command to run a sample console application:

```console
docker run --rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/samples
```

## Container sample: Run a web application

You can quickly run a container with a pre-built [.NET Core Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-samples/), based on the [ASP.NET Core sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/aspnetapp/README.md).

Type the following command to run a sample web application:

```console
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:80 --name aspnetcore_sample mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/samples:aspnetapp
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser. On Windows, you may need to navigate to the container via IP address. See [ASP.NET Core apps in Windows Containers](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/aspnetapp/aspnetcore-docker-windows.md) for instructions on determining the IP address, using the value of `--name` that you used in `docker run`.

See [Hosting ASP.NET Core Images with Docker over HTTPS](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/aspnetapp/aspnetcore-docker-https.md) to use HTTPS with this image.
