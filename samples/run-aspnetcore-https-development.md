# Developing ASP.NET Core Applications with Docker over HTTPS

ASP.NET Core uses [HTTPS by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl). [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) relies on [certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) for trust, identity, and encryption.

This document demonstrates how to develop ASP.NET Core applications with HTTPS in Docker containers. It's recommended to try the [ASP.NET Core Docker Sample](README.md) first, which is simpler because the container only exposes HTTP. This more basic tutorial will help you validate that you have the sample working correctly, before adding the complication of certificates.

See [Hosting ASP.NET Core images with Docker over HTTPS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/docker-https) for production scenarios.

Windows instructions are written for PowerShell. If you are using CMD, change the format of environment variables from `${env:USERPROFILE}` to `%USERPROFILE%`.

This example requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). We recommend the latest version.

## Getting the sample image

Pull the sample image:

```console
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

Alternatively, you can build the sample image locally:

```console
docker build --pull -t mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp 'https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker.git#:samples/aspnetapp'
```

## Create and trust a development certificate

Follow the instructions for creating a [.NET development certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-dev-certs) from [Running pre-built container images with HTTPS](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/docker-https#running-pre-built-container-images-with-https).

## Enable HTTPS using environment variables

See [Hosting ASP.NET Core images with Docker over HTTPS](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/docker-https). See the following section if you don't want to use environment variables to store your development
certificate password.

## Using user secrets for certificate password

Rather than using environment variable to specify the development certificate password,  use [.NET user secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) to store the password.

Initializing user-secrets for the first time on a project modifies the project file, so you will need a local copy of the `aspnetapp` sample. Clone this repo or [download the repository as a zip](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/archive/main.zip).

```console
git clone https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/
```

Initialize user secrets for your app, and set the certificate password:

```console
cd samples/aspnetapp
dotnet user-secrets init -p aspnetapp/aspnetapp.csproj
dotnet user-secrets -p aspnetapp/aspnetapp.csproj set "Kestrel:Certificates:Default:Password" $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER
```

Since initializing user-secrets modified the project file, re-build the sample image:

```pwsh
docker build --pull -t aspnetapp .
```

In Linux containers, .NET looks under the `~/.microsoft/usersecrets/` directory for user secrets data. Bind-mount your host machine's user secrets directory to the container's filesystem. If you are running your container as the `root` user, replace `/home/app/` with the `root` user's home directory, `/root/`.

**Linux containers on Windows:**

```pwsh
docker run --rm -it `
    -p 8001:8001 `
    -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORTS=8001 `
    -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development `
    -v ${env:APPDATA}/microsoft/UserSecrets/:/home/app/.microsoft/usersecrets `
    -v ${env:USERPROFILE}/.aspnet/https/:/https/ `
    -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx `
    aspnetapp
```

**Linux containers on macOS or Linux:**

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    -p 8001:8001 \
    -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORTS=8001 \
    -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development \
    -v ${HOME}/.microsoft/usersecrets/:/home/app/.microsoft/usersecrets \
    -v ${HOME}/.aspnet/https/:/https/ \
    -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx \
    aspnetapp
```

**Windows containers on Windows:**

```pwsh
docker run --rm -it `
    -p 8001:8001 `
    -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORTS=8001 `
    -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development `
    -v ${env:APPDATA}\microsoft\UserSecrets\:C:\Users\ContainerUser\AppData\Roaming\microsoft\UserSecrets `
    -v ${env:USERPROFILE}\.aspnet\https:C:\https `
    aspnetapp
```

After the application starts, navigate to `https://localhost:8001` in your web
browser.
