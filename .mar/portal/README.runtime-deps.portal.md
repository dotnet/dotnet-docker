## About

This image contains the native dependencies needed by .NET. It does not include .NET. It is for [self-contained](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/deploying/index) applications.

Watch [discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions/categories/announcements) for Docker-related .NET announcements.

### New: Ubuntu Chiseled Images

Ubuntu Chiseled .NET images are a type of "distroless" container image that contain only the minimal set of packages .NET needs, with everything else removed.
These images offer dramatically smaller deployment sizes and attack surface by including only the minimal set of packages required to run .NET applications.

Please see the [Ubuntu Chiseled + .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/ubuntu-chiseled.md) documentation page for more info.

## Usage

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

* [.NET self-contained Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/README.md) - This [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/Dockerfile.debian-x64-slim) builds and runs an application as a self-contained application.

## Image Variants

.NET container images have several variants that offer different combinations of flexibility and deployment size.
The [Image Variants documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/image-variants.md) contains a summary of the image variants and their use-cases.
