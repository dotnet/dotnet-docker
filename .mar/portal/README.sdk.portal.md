## About

This image contains the .NET SDK which is comprised of three parts:

1. .NET CLI
1. .NET runtime
1. ASP.NET Core

Use this image for your development process (developing, building and testing applications).

Watch [discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions/categories/announcements) for Docker-related .NET announcements.

## Usage

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

### Building .NET Apps with Docker

* [.NET Docker Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/README.md) - This [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/Dockerfile) builds, tests, and runs the sample. It includes and builds multiple projects.
* [ASP.NET Core Docker Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/README.md) - This [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/Dockerfile) demonstrates using Docker with an ASP.NET Core Web App.

### Develop .NET Apps in a Container

The following samples show how to develop, build and test .NET applications with Docker without the need to install the .NET SDK.

* [Build .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/build-in-sdk-container.md)
* [Test .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/run-tests-in-sdk-container.md)
* [Run .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/run-in-sdk-container.md)

### Tag Formatting

#### .NET Versions

All .NET container images have both "fixed version" and "floating version" tags.
Floating version tags will always reference the latest version of a specific .NET major version, while fixed version tags will always only reference a specific patch version.
For all tags below, `<.NET Version>` can be substituted for either `<Major.Minor>` or `<Major.Minor.Patch>`, for example: `7.0` or `7.0.12`.

#### Single-platform tags

These "fixed version" tags reference an image with a specific .NET version for a specific operating system and architecture.

- `<.NET Version>-<OS>-<Architecture>`
- `<.NET Version>-<OS>-<variant>-<Architecture>`
- `<.NET Version>-<OS>-<Architecture>`
- `<.NET Version>-<OS>-<variant>-<Architecture>`

#### Multi-platform tags

These tags reference images for [multiple platforms](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/).

- `<.NET Version>`
    - The version-only floating tag refers to the latest Debian version available at the .NET Major Version's release.
- `<.NET Version>-<OS>`
- `<.NET Version>-<OS>-<variant>`

### Image Variants

By default, Ubuntu and Debian images for .NET 8 will have both `icu` and `tzdata` installed.

Our Alpine and Ubuntu Chiseled images are focused on size.
These images do not and will not include `icu` or `tzdata`, meaning that these images only work iwth apps that are configured for [globalization-invariant mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/globalization).
Apps that require globalization support can use the `extra` image variant.

#### (Preview) `aot`

`aot` images provide an optimized deployment size for [native AOT](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/) compiled .NET apps.
Native AOT has the lowest size, startup time, and memory footprint of all .NET deployment models.
Please see ["Limiatations of Native AOT deployment"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot#limitations-of-native-aot-deployment) to see if your app might be compatible.

Example tags:
- `8.0.100-jammy-aot`
- `8.0-alpine3.18-aot`

**Note:** `aot` images are only available as a preview in the [dotnet/nightly/sdk](https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/dotnet/nightly/sdk/about) and [dotnet/nightly/runtime-deps](https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/dotnet/nightly/runtime-deps/about) repos.
Native AOT compiled apps will function exactly the same on the existing `runtime-deps` (non-`aot`) images, but with a larger deployment size.
Please try these new, smaller images out and give us feedback!
