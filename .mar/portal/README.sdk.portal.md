## About

**IMPORTANT**

**The images from the dotnet/nightly repositories include last-known-good (LKG) builds for the next release of [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core).**

**See [dotnet](https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/dotnet/sdk/about) for images with official releases of [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core).**

This image contains the .NET SDK which is comprised of three parts:

1. .NET CLI
1. .NET runtime
1. ASP.NET Core

Use this image for your development process (developing, building and testing applications).

Watch [discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions/categories/announcements) for Docker-related .NET announcements.

## Usage

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

### Building .NET Apps with Docker

* [.NET Docker Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/README.md) - This [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/dotnetapp/Dockerfile) builds, tests, and runs the sample. It includes and builds multiple projects.
* [ASP.NET Core Docker Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/README.md) - This [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/Dockerfile) demonstrates using Docker with an ASP.NET Core Web App.

### Develop .NET Apps in a Container

The following samples show how to develop, build and test .NET applications with Docker without the need to install the .NET SDK.

* [Build .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/build-in-sdk-container.md)
* [Test .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/run-tests-in-sdk-container.md)
* [Run .NET Applications with SDK Container](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/run-in-sdk-container.md)
