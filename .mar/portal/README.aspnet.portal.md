## About

**IMPORTANT**

**The images from the dotnet/nightly repositories include last-known-good (LKG) builds for the next release of [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core).**

**See [dotnet](https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/dotnet/aspnet/about) for images with official releases of [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core).**

This image contains the ASP.NET Core and .NET runtimes and libraries and is optimized for running ASP.NET Core apps in production.

### Composite container images

Starting from .NET 8, a composite version of the ASP.NET images, `denoted with the -composite` tag part, is being offered alongside the regular image. The main characteristics of these images are their smaller size on disk while keeping the performance of the default [ReadyToRun (R2R) setting](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run). The caveat is that the composite images have tighter version coupling. This means the final app run on them cannot use handpicked custom versions of the framework and/or ASP.NET assemblies that are built into the composite binary.

For a full technical description on how the composites work, we have a [feature doc here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/features/readytorun-composite-format-design.md).

Watch [discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions/categories/announcements) for Docker-related .NET announcements.

## Usage

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

### Container sample: Run a web application

You can quickly run a container with a pre-built [.NET Docker image](https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/dotnet/samples/about), based on the [ASP.NET Core sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/README.md).

Type the following command to run a sample web application:

```console
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8080 --name aspnetcore_sample mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser. You can also view the ASP.NET Core site running in the container from another machine with a local IP address such as `http://192.168.1.18:8000`.

> Note: ASP.NET Core apps (in official images) listen to [port 8080 by default](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/6da64f31944bb16ecde5495b6a53fc170fbe100d/src/runtime-deps/8.0/bookworm-slim/amd64/Dockerfile#L7), starting with .NET 8. The [`-p` argument](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#publish) in these examples maps host port `8000` to container port `8080` (`host:container` mapping). The container will not be accessible without this mapping. ASP.NET Core can be [configured to listen on a different or additional port](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints).
