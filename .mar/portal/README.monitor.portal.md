## About

This image contains the .NET Monitor tool.

Use this image as a sidecar container to collect diagnostic information from other containers running .NET Core 3.1 or later processes.

Watch [discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/discussions/categories/announcements) for Docker-related .NET announcements.

### New: Ubuntu Chiseled images

Ubuntu Chiseled .NET images are a type of "distroless" container image that contain only the minimal set of packages .NET needs, with everything else removed.
These images offer dramatically smaller deployment sizes and attack surface by including only the minimal set of packages required to run .NET applications.

Please see the [Ubuntu Chiseled + .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/ubuntu-chiseled.md) documentation page for more info.

## Usage

The [.NET Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

### Container sample: Run the tool

You can run a container with a pre-built [.NET Docker Image](https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/dotnet/monitor/about), based on the dotnet-monitor global tool.

See the [documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2158052) for how to configure the image to be run in a Docker or Kubernetes environment, including how to configure authentication and certificates for https bindings.

### Tag Formatting

#### .NET Versions

All .NET container images have both "fixed version" and "floating version" tags.
Floating version tags will always reference the latest version of a specific .NET major version, while fixed version tags will always only reference a specific patch version.
For all tags below, `<.NET Version>` can be substituted for either `<Major.Minor>` or `<Major.Minor.Patch>`, for example: `7.0` or `7.0.12`.

#### Single-platform tags

These "fixed version" tags reference an image with a specific .NET version for a specific operating system and architecture.

- `<.NET Version>-<OS>-<Architecture>`
- `<.NET Version>-<OS>-<variant>-<Architecture>`
- `<.NET Version>-<OS>-<Architecture>`
- `<.NET Version>-<OS>-<variant>-<Architecture>`

#### Multi-platform tags

These tags reference images for [multiple platforms](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/).

- `<.NET Version>`
    - The version-only floating tag refers to the latest Debian version available at the .NET Major Version's release.
- `<.NET Version>-<OS>`
- `<.NET Version>-<OS>-<variant>`

#### Image Variants

By default, Ubuntu and Debian images for .NET 8 will have both `icu` and `tzdata` installed.
These images are intended to satisfy the most common use cases of .NET developers.

Our Alpine and Ubuntu Chiseled images are focused on size.
These images do not and will not include `icu` or `tzdata`, meaning that these images only work iwth apps that are configured for [globalization-invariant mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/globalization).
Apps that require globalization support can use the `extra` image variant of the [dotnet/runtime-deps](https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/dotnet/runtime-deps/about) images.

Example tags:
- `8.0-bookworm-slim`
- `6.0-jammy`
- `7.0-alpine3.18-arm64v8`
